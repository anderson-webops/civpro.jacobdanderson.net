# Codex Guidance

This is Civ Pro: Trial Ready, a dependency-light browser game and public teaching artifact for Civil Procedure practice.

Use these commands from this directory:

- `npm ci`
- `npm run audit`
- `npm run check`

Project constraints:

- Keep provider credentials, restricted-source caches, operator scripts, and private source material outside `dist/client`.
- Preserve the explicit public-artifact allowlist and the local-only storage boundary documented in `README.md`.
- Treat direct PACER access as optional, server-side, credentialed, and potentially fee-bearing.

## Public Repository and Secret Handling

- Treat this repository and every committed file as public information.
- Never commit `.env`, `.env.*`, credentials, access tokens, private keys, signing material, restricted-source caches, or environment-specific private paths. Track only scrubbed templates such as `.env.example`, with blank or unmistakably fake values.
- Before staging or publishing, inspect `git status --short`, review the staged diff, and run a redacted secret scan when available. Confirm that ignored local credential files remain ignored.
- If a real secret ever enters tracked content or Git history, stop publication, remove it from the affected history, and rotate or revoke the credential before pushing or changing visibility.

## Commit, Tag, and Release Policy

- Commit coherent, validated increments frequently: normally after each focused change passes its relevant checks and before switching to a different concern. Preserve unrelated user work and do not fold it into an unclear commit.
- Push validated commits as the normal completion step so the public repository stays current.
- Create tags less frequently, only for meaningful version, citation, submission, or compatibility milestones. An ordinary commit does not need a tag.
- Publish a release only at a milestone with aligned version metadata, release notes, verified artifacts and checksums where applicable, and passing release checks. Use a draft or prerelease for genuinely provisional milestones, a source-only release when that is the intended artifact, and a stable release only when the documented stable benchmark is met.

## Direct Delivery and Pull Requests

- After a coherent change set passes the repository's required checks, default to committing it and pushing it directly to the repository's default branch. Do not open a pull request unless the user explicitly asks for one, branch protection requires it, or an external-contribution policy makes direct integration inappropriate.
- For a release-worthy application change, update the project version as required, create an annotated tag, and publish or update the corresponding GitHub release in the same work session. Keep documentation-only, formatting-only, and other non-deployable housekeeping changes as committed and pushed source changes without inventing an application release.
- Never force-push a shared branch or move an existing published tag unless the user explicitly authorizes that exact history rewrite.
- If automation or repository policy creates a pull request, review it, wait for required checks, merge it when safe, and remove the merged branch before wrapping up. Do not leave redundant pull requests or branches open.
- Treat commit, push, tag, and GitHub release publication as source delivery only. Do not claim or perform production deployment unless it was separately authorized and verified.
